Project Drishti is basically a gesture to speech convertor. The general definition of gesture recognition is the ability of a computer to understand gestures and execute commands based on those gestures.

The reason for naming this project _Drishti_ is because I made the use of __"Drishti"__(Vision) of machines to recognize the hand gestures of the subject (in our case a person) and predict the corresponding alphabet. I have also made the use of text to speech convertor to provide a voice enabled output.

### Input Data-
The input for this project is the [MNIST Gesture recognition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist).

The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (excluding J and Z which require motion) and follows the same CSV format with labels and pixel values in single rows.

### Challenges :
- Creating a deep learning model for hand gesture classification. 
- Being able to extract and isolate the hand gestures  as images from OpenCV frames and apply the DL model to the images and return the frames.
- Using flask to create the web app for this project.
- Managing the version conflicts in anaconda.

### Dependencies -
- Python 3.10
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Keras
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- PIL
- Matplotlib


- The output should look like the one given below.
